# NSE-Nifty50-Stock-Analysis
INTRODUCTION:
Overview:
In this project I have created an analysis of certain sectors that form a part of the NSE 50 index on the basis of stock prices.
The companies are classified according to the industry they belong to. 
We can understand the trend in which the share price of the companies in each sector varies on a yearly basis.
We can also assess the volatility of a given equity share in a given period/duration by analysing whether it is worthwhile investing in that scrip.
The graphs use an interactive approach to held the user analyse the dips and ups in prices and thereby invest in fundamentally sound companies when their prices dip owing to various external factors.

PURPOSE:
There are a lot of parameters to identify a fundamentally strong company for equity investment.
Analysing the price movement is one such parameter.Of course, this is not the only parameter but it still is a critical factor in determining when to buy scrip.
This project is to display the intricacies of price movements of companies in major sectors that form a part of the NIFTY50 index.
All 50 companies that form the part of the above index have not been considered in this project for the sake of simplicity and elegance.
